# 🏨 ChefHotel – Hotel Landing Page

ChefHotel is a stylish hotel landing page built using pure HTML and CSS. It showcases elegant layout design, responsive sections, and visual storytelling—perfect for practicing frontend structure and styling.
The project simulates a real-world hotel website, helping me practice without JavaScript.
